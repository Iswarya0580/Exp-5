# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement and SRS of a Student Enrollment System and represent its system architecture using UML diagrams.`
# SRS (Procedure):
```
Analyze the Student Enrollment System and model its components through the following UML diagrams:

1.Use Case Diagram – Identifies actors (e.g., Student, Admin, Faculty) and system functionalities (e.g., Enroll in Course, Drop Course, View Schedule, Approve Enrollment).
2.Class Diagram – Represents system classes such as Student, Course, Enrollment, Faculty, and their relationships and attributes (e.g., courseCode, studentID).
3.Activity Diagram – Describes workflows such as student course enrollment, course approval by faculty, and withdrawal from a course.
4.Sequence Diagram – Illustrates object interactions in time sequence during operations like enrolling a student in a course.
5.Communication Diagram – Highlights interactions between system components such as Student, Enrollment Module, Course Database, and Admin during an enrollment process.
6.Package Diagram – Organizes system components into logical modules such as User Management, Enrollment Module, Course Management, and Schedule System.
